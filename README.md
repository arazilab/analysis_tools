# analysis_tools
This repository contains a collection of lightweight and customizable analysis tools built for use in our lab. These tools are designed to work directly with the outputs of annotation tools used by our lab, making it easier to explore, summarize, and quality-check annotation results through simple, browser-based interfaces.
